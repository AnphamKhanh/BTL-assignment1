the most common data imputation techniques.\n","\n","The **SimpleImputer** class provides basic strategies for imputing missing values, including:\n","\n","- Mean and median imputation for numerical variables\n","- Most frequent category imputation for categorical variables\n","- Arbitrary value imputation for both categorical and numerical variables\n","\n","### Advantages\n","\n","- Simple to use if applied to the entire dataframe\n","- Maintained by the scikit-learn developers: good quality code\n","- Fast computation (it uses numpy for calculations)\n","- Allows for grid search over the various imputation techniques\n","- Allows for different missing values encodings (you can indicate if the missing values are np.nan, or zeroes, etc)\n","\n","### Limitations\n","\n","- Returns a numpy array instead of a pandas dataframe, inconvenient for data analysis\n","- Needs to use additional classes to select which features to impute  ==>\n","    - requires more lines of code\n","    - additional classes still in beta (may change without warning)\n","    - not so straightforward to use anymore.\n","\n","### More details about the transformers\n","\n","- [SimpleImputer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer.html#sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer)\n","-
